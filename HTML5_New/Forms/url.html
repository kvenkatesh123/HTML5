<!--

	<input> elements of type "url" are used to let the user enter and edit a URL. The input value is automatically validated to ensure that it's either empty or a properly-formatted URL before the form can be submitted. The :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes are automatically applied as appropriate to visually denote whether the current value of the field is a valid URL or not.
