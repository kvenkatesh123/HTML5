<!--

	The HTML Bidirectional Isolation element (<bdi>)  contains text which may be rendered using a different text direction than the surrounding text. This lets you, for example, present a quote in Arabic (which is written right-to-left) within a paragraph written in English (written left-to-right).

	<p dir="ltr">This arabic word <bdi>ARABIC_PLACEHOLDER</bdi>
is automatically displayed right-to-left.</p>
